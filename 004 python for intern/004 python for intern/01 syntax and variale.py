# # Python Variables
# # Variables are containers for storing data values.

# # Example
# x = 5
# y = "harsh"
# print(x)
# print(y)

# x = 4       # x is of type int
# print(type(x))

# x = "Sally" # x is now of type str
# # print(x)
# print(type(x))

# x = str(3)    # x will be '3'
# y = int(3)    # y will be 3
# z = float(3)  # z will be 3.0

# print(x)
# print(type(x))
# print(y)
# print(type(y))
# print(z)
# print(type(z))

# # Get the Type
# # You can get the data type of a variable with the type() function.

# x = 5
# y = "John"
# print(type(x))
# print(type(y))


# # Case-Sensitive
# # Variable names are case-sensitive.
# # Example
# # This will create two variables:

# a = 4
# A = "Sally"
# print(a)
# print(A)
#A will not overwrite a

# # Variable Names
# # Legal variable names:

# myvar = "John"
# my_var = "John"
# _my_var = "John"
# myVar = "John"
# MYVAR = "John"
# myvar2 = "John"

# # Illegal variable names:

# 2myvar = "John"
# my-var = "John"
# my var = "John"

# # Many Values to Multiple Variables
# x, y, z = "Orange", "Banana", "Cherry"
# print(x)
# print(y)
# print(z)


# # One Value to Multiple Variables
# x = y = z = "Orange"
# print(x)
# print(y)
# print(z)



# # Unpack a list:

# fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
# x, y, z = fruits
# print(x)
# print(y)
# print(z)

# # For numbers, the + character works as a mathematical operator:
# x = 5
# y = 10
# print(x + y)

# x = 5
# y = "John"
# print(x + y)
# # it gives error str and int are not adding
