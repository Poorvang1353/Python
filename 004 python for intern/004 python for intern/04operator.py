# # Python Operators
# # Python divides the operators in the following groups:

# # Arithmetic operators
# # Assignment operators
# # Comparison operators
# # Membership operators

# # Arithmetic operators
# x = 30
# y = 10
# +	Addition	
# print(x + y	)
# -	Subtraction	
# print(x - y	)
# # *	Multiplication	
# print(x * y	)
# # /	Division	
# print(x / y	)
# %	Modulus	
# print(x % y	)
# # **	Exponentiation	
# print(x ** y )
# //	Floor division	
# print(x // y)

# # Assignment Operators
# # =	
# x = 5	

# +=	
# x += 3
# print(x)

# -=	
# x -= 3
# print(x)
# # *=	
# x *= 3
# print(x)	

# # Comparison Operators
# ==	Equal	
# x == y	
# # !=	Not equal	
# x != y	
# # >	Greater than
# x > y	
# # <	Less than
# x < y	
# # >=	Greater than or equal to
# x >= y	
# # <=	Less than or equal to
# x <= y

# # Membership Operators
# # in 	Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is present in the object	
# x in y	

# # not in	Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is not present in the object	
# x not in y
